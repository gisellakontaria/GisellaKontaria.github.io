# Solar Chapter ‚òÄÔ∏è

Solar Chapter is a student-run NGO that is committed to increase water access and literacy rate in rural parts of Eastern Indonesia through sustainable means. We have helped a total of 6 villages and still counting!


## Task
The NGO wants a brand new website that can storytell their mission to both potential sponsors and the public. I am the sole UI designer and one of the three frontend developers who volunteered to take on the project.

## Problem Statement
Previous website is outdated, has low site traffic, and each component feels disconnected to one another.

## Challenges
1. How can we include non-sponsors contribute to the cause
2. How do we provide a cohesive yet straightforward flow of information in one scroll
3. Put emphasis on the urgency of the problems and how the NGO drives impact
