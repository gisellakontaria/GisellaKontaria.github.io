# **Hey, I'm Gisella, <br> nice to meet you 👋**
I’d love to chat about anything – from software that provides social good to products and design. I’m passionate about leveraging data to automate quantitative design insights and improve user experience. When not in school, you can find me reading, running, grabbing a Matcha Oat Latte, or binge-watching Netflix!
